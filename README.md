# Australian Open Data Visualisation Project
This project explores and visualises 118 years of Australian Open tennis data (1905â€“2023), focusing on identifying trends, analysing top players, and observing national and gender-based performance patterns.
<br /><br />
### Key Highlights:
### 1. Data Analysis:
- Processed and explored historical data on Australian Open matches for both men and women.
- Analysed attributes like match year, player names, nationalities, seeds, scores, and match outcomes.
- Focused on players with 5 or more wins to identify key patterns and trends.

### 2. Calculations and Transformations:
- Created Tableau calculations to determine:
  - Match win rates and percentages.
  - Set-by-set performance metrics.
- Introduced transformations to visualise free-text scores as structured data for easier analysis.

### 3. Visualisation Techniques:
- Developed 10 Tableau sheets, showcasing diverse visualisation methods:
  - Treemap: Highlighted winning records by country and gender.
  - Parallel Coordinates: Compared players' win rates across matches and sets.
  - Geographic Map: Displayed performance patterns by nationality.
  - Scatter Chart: Illustrated player-specific win rates and match outcomes.

### 4. Findings:
- Observed dominance of certain countries like Australia and the USA in both wins and runner-up positions.
- Identified trends in gender-based participation and performance over time.
- Highlighted outliers, such as specific years with exceptional win rates or players breaking historical norms.
<br /><br />
### Advantages of Tableau:
- Enabled quick creation of interactive dashboards and insights.
- Supported diverse visualisation styles and complex calculations.
- Highlighted limitations like restricted custom formatting and lack of scheduling for automated updates.
<br /><br />
### Tools Used:
- Tableau: For advanced visualisation and storytelling.
- Excel: For data preparation and formatting.
<br /><br />
This project is a comprehensive demonstration of advanced data visualisation techniques, leveraging Tableau's capabilities to uncover insights and present them interactively to an audience passionate about tennis. Detailed reports and interactive dashboards are available within the project folder.
